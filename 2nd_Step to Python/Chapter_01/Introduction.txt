Programming:
Programming is basically a process of giving the instructions to the computer to solve a particular
problem.

Programming Language:
It is the language which we use to instruct the computer to solve that particular problem.

Types of Programming Languages:
1. High Level language
2. Low Level Language

1. High Level Language:
It is the language which is for the humans not for the computers have been made for the ease of 
Humans. It is actually converted to the machine language for the understanding by the computers.
Examples: C++, Python, C, Java etc

2. Low Level Language:
It is the language which directly interacts with the hardware specially made for the computer. It 
is very hard to understand by the Human.
Examples: Assembly Language etd

Types of Codes:
1. Source Codes
2. Object Codes

1. Source Code:
It is the code which is written by the Human for the interaction with the computer to solve a 
particular problem.
Example: The code which we write in languages like Python,C++,Java is the Source code.

2. Object Code:
It is the code which directly interacts with the hardware for the internal operations.
Example: The code which is being written min the Assembly language etc 

How many ways are ther for Source Code Translation into Machine Code?
1. Compiler
2. Interpreter

1. Compiler:
It is the tool which converts the source code into the machine code colectively (All at the same 
time).
Examples: C++ Source Code Translation.

2. Interpreter: 
It is the tool which translate the source code into the machine code line by line stops the 
execution wherever finds the error
Example: Python Source Code Translation

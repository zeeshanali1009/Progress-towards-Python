Exception handling is the important part of the programming as we are controlling the errors through this 
process and there are three types of errors which are as :
1. Compile time errors
2. Runtime errors
3. Logical errors 


try  --- except 
in the try block we are using the block of code in which we suspect that there will be the errors
in the except block we add the code which will execute in case of the expected error 


try   ----except ---- finally 
in the try block we are using the block of code in which we suspect that there will be the errors
in the except block we add the code which will execute in case of the expected error 
the block of code which is in the finally block will always be executed 

nested --- try  --- except 
it is the nested try except and it will be executed as there are the executions of the nested loops

Object oriented programming is an important concept use for the better programming approach and removes the 
previous older approach
redundancy
easy modular approach 

There are the two following things in the oop:
1. properties or attributes  (these are the properties like what are the characteristics)
2. behaviours or methods (behaviours means how these chracteristics will perform)

There are the 4 important things in the oop
1. Inheritance   (reusing the properties and methods)
2. Encapsulation  (controling the access and control)
3. Abstarction   (hiding the complex details)
4. Polymorphism  (One particular thing and many shapes)

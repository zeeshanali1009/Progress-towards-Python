# Comaprison operaters are used for the comparison of the values or the variables though variables also 
# stores the values

# let Suppose

first_variable = 20
second_variable = 30

# greater then operater 
print (first_variable > second_variable)
# Smaller then operater 
print (first_variable < second_variable)
# Greater then equal to operater 
print (first_variable >= second_variable)
# Smaller then equal to Operater
print (first_variable >= second_variable)
# Equal to operater
print (first_variable == second_variable)
# Not equal to operter 
print (first_variable != second_variable)

# repeat in the string would be like the continuous repetetion of the particular string instead of the 
# multiplication
# in case of integer value 
print("In case of integer values: ")
number = 100
print(number * 10)

print("In case of string values: ")
number = "100"
print(number * 10)          # there you can see the continuous repetetion of the string value

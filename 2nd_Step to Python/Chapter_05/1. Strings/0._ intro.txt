strings are the datatype of the python used to store the data into it
Actually the data is enclosed into the inverted commas
these are the following chracteristics of the strings:

1. immutable  (cannot be changed although can be replaced)
2. indexed      (every chracter of it is indexed)
        further indexing can be done by using the slicing method.
3. iterable     (strings are iterable)

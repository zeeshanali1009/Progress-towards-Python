functions are being used in the programming languages to use the certain block of code for the multiple times
there are many  advantages for using the functions:
-------resuability (code can be reused)
-------modularity   (modualar approach makes the code easy to understand)
-------scopping      (scope of the code already defined so can be used wisely)

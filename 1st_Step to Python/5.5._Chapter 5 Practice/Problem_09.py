# Can you change the value in the set 's list 
# S= {12,34,56,78,"Zeehan",{1,2,3}


S= {12,34,56,78,"Zeehan",{1,2,3}}

# no this cannot be possible as the values cannot get changed like sets are not indexed 
# so we cannot access any specific memory locations like they are unorders also they have just one 
# property which is it have unique memory locations cannot have same members

# in this section we will be learning the impact and use of different virtual environment as there can be the 
# different virtual environements with the installation of different kind of versions of packages 
# in this program first of all i have install the pandas. compiler will automatically install the version 
# of the pandas but if we want to change it then we can but at one time we can use only one version and 
# then we can use only the version that we installed lately 

# Then we will be creating the virtual environrment as the "Virtualenv"

# on the other hand if we open the windows terminal and start the same process as installing the pandas then
# you have to keep in mind on thing that this installation will be the global one as it will installl the version
# globally can be changed as well but can be used one at the single time 
# windows terminal can be used to activate the virtual environment 

# pip freeze > versions.txt 
# upper statement will be storing all the installed versions information in the seperate file for the 
# information purpose an dto use it in the future as well 

# pip freeze -r versions.txt 
# we can use the all the versions information in the future by using the file
